object oriented python

'''
What is object oriented programming?
-it is structuring you programming so that you are budling related properties and behaviors into objects
-this won't be a OOP toutorial, but a OOP in python tutorial
'''

# you could represetnt some data for some items data you need to sore, but it is clunky
# we can use objects instead and in python it is similar to how you would do it in other lanuages
monster = ['orc', 23, 'guard', 4]
human = ['human', 14, 'knight', 6]

note to self make all this some powerpoint slides later


first some keywords:

class 
- this is how you define a class in python
- like in other languages class is the 'blueprint' you use to build an object
- angain like in other languages an instance of an object means that the blueprint has been used to make an object and you are using it
- this keyword is followed by the name of the class then a ':' similar to how in other languages you use {}

__init__()
- this is what in other languages is the constuctor method

self
- this the same as using 'this' in java
- every method in an object's class has to have this as the first parameter
- when you call it you don't use self, you use it when you make the class 
- this included the __init__() too

now lets move to a new file that we will called
